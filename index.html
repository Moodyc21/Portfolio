        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As you may have seen, my name is Christopher Moody. I am a Web Developer, which is a broad term, in Atlanta, GA. I like starting projects from scratch and seeing fresh ideas through the entire creative process of building websites and applications. With that said I most enjoy the challenge of building logic with JavaScript/Jquery to run applications. That is where I get most of my enjoyment in Web Development. I also like playing guitar, skateboarding, golf and pretty much anything that is exciting and dangerous. I got into Web Development because I already have a good knowledge of elecetronics and hardware and always wanted to learn how to program and tell those machines what to do. It fascinates me! Anyways, thank you for visiting my page and checkout my work if you get a chance. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
